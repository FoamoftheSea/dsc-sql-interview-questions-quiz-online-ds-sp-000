    " - Left/Right: In a left/right join, the resulting table will contain all original rows of the table on the left/right of the join, having those rows which share a value in the column being joined on expanded with the columns from the other table. This is a good join to use if you have incomplete data in the second table and wish to preserve all of the data in the first. Sometimes, the rows which relate between the tables are also removed, leaving only the left/right table with all rows which did not have a relationship to data in the other table.\n",
    " - Outer: In an outer join, all rows from both tables are kept, and related wherever possible. Again, sometimes the related rows are removed, to have a resulting table which only contains rows that were not related over the column being joined on."

Alternatively, one may wish to see what the highest purchase amount each customer has made: they would group their data by customer, and find the maximum value for each."

    "A good example of the role of an Associative Entity in action is relating a table of data describing individual actors with a table with data describing individual films. Each actor will have been in many films, and each film will have many actors, so these tables will not have a column with the foreign key needed to relate to the other properly. Thus, an Associative Entity (a junction table) is used, which is a table which contains the foreign keys for both tables, showing every combination of actor/film, which can relate the two tables in a many-to-many join."
